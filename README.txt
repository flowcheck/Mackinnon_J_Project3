# Project 3 for class 1056
=======
# This is supposed to show us the abilities of Flexbox

# Had massive issues with getting my boxes working as you can see. Worked the issue for a few days and all night on 2/9/2021 and couldn't get it working

# As you can see with the design files I had the layout down, I just couldn't for the life of me get the CSS to work.

# Will be studying hard for the FIP and mid-term. Thank you for class so far Marco!
